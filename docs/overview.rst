Overview
========

Cisco Software Manager Plugin Engine provides a mechanism for dispatching
and executing plugin's code.

It can be installed together with CSM Server or as a standalone module.

The standalone functionality is useful for plugin development and testing.
The Plugin code can be executed outside the CSM Server code using the CLI script.

Together with CSM Plugin Engine a several core plugins have been bundled providing
the minimal functionality required for CSM Server handling the install operations and
the basic Pre-Check and Post-Check checking.


The custom plugins can be structured and installed as any other standard python modules.
